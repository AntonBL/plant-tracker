## 🎯 Recommended Development Approach

### Phase 1: Offline-First MVP (Week 1-2)
**Goal:** Working iOS app with local storage

**Build:**
- ✅ SwiftUI app with basic UI
- ✅ Local storage with SwiftData
- ✅ CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete plants)
- ✅ Watering tracking (local only)
- ✅ Local notifications for watering reminders
- ✅ Camera/photo library integration

**You'll have:** A fully functional app you can use yourself!

### Phase 2: Add Backend (Week 3-4)
**Goal:** FastAPI backend with API sync

**Build:**
- ✅ FastAPI backend with endpoints
- ✅ Database (SQLite to start)
- ✅ API client in iOS app
- ✅ Background sync (local → server)
- ✅ Image upload and storage

**You'll have:** Multi-device sync capability!

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 5+)
**Goal:** Image analysis and advanced features

**Build:**
- ✅ Plant health analysis (Claude Vision API)
- ✅ Push notifications (if needed)
- ✅ Sharing plants with friends
- ✅ Advanced analytics

**You'll have:** A polished, feature-rich app!

## 💡 Key Insights from Meal Planner v2

### ✅ What Worked Well

1. **Starting Simple**
   - Began with file-based storage before databases
   - Used Streamlit (simple) instead of React (complex)
   - Added features incrementally

2. **Strong Architecture**
   - Repository pattern made storage swappable
   - Service layer kept business logic organized
   - Dependency injection made testing easy

3. **Type Safety**
   - Type hints caught bugs early
   - Made refactoring safer
   - Improved IDE autocomplete

4. **Comprehensive Logging**
   - Structured logging helped debug production issues
   - Context in logs made troubleshooting faster

5. **Testing**
   - Tests provided confidence during refactoring
   - Mocked dependencies kept tests fast
   - AAA pattern made tests readable

### ⚠️ Lessons Learned

1. **Don't Over-Engineer Early**
   - Started with complex abstractions that weren't needed
   - YAGNI principle is real – build what you need NOW

2. **Logging is Critical**
   - Wished we had more logging from day 1
   - Structured logging (with context) >> simple messages

3. **Document as You Go**
   - Architecture decisions are hard to remember later
   - Claude.md file is invaluable for consistency

4. **Fail Fast with Validation**
   - Early input validation prevents debugging later
   - Type hints + Pydantic catch issues at the boundary

5. **Test Outcomes, Not Implementation**
   - Implementation-focused tests break during refactoring
   - Outcome-focused tests remain stable
